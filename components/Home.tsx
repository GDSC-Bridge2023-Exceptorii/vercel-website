        <Text>Digital divide is a matter of inequality and disadvantages beyond  inconvenience. It leads to social and economic gaps. We develop customized digital education services for the elderly to address digital gaps and inequalities. 
          For example, online banking, which is difficult for the elderly, causes inefficiency in banking.
          The elimination of inequality over the digital divide provides everyone with opportunities for fair education, information gathering, and information utilization.
